### _Remote Monitoring Base Station_
• Monitor environmental parameters like Temperature and
Relative Humidity, Air Quality parameters like CO 2 and CO
Level, Methane and Butane Gas Level, LPG Level remotely to
keep a track of environmental pollution
• Rather than having a monitoring station at every city / county,
we can have a remotely monitoring base station which can
monitor multiple cities from a single base station.

### _Fire Detection System_
• Monitor parameters like temperature and smoke to detect /
prevent Fire.
• In case of emergencies, the system will notify the residents and
neighbors for Fire Alert through SMS.
• In this way, the residents can be alerted even when they are not
at home which will prevent any major loss of life or property.
• Also, the neighbors are notified which can in return help those
who are in need and can even take precautionary actions.
